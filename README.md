A Hybrid Approach For Crop Yield Prediction Using Gradient  Enhanced Multiple Linear Polynomial Model
ABSTRACT
Accurate crop yield prediction is essential for boosting agricultural productivity, ensuring
food security, and allocating resources as effectively as feasible. Traditional yield prediction
models sometimes fail to capture the complex, non-linear interactions among numerous
agricultural factors, such as soil conditions, farming practices, and climate, leading to
inefficiencies and poor generalization. This paper introduces the Gradient-Enhanced
Multiple Linear Polynomial Model (GEMLP), a hybrid machine learning method that
combines Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and
Polynomial Regression to improve predictive accuracy. To improve performance, the new
model applies feature engineering, polynomial expansion, standardization, and
hyperparameter optimization on historical yield data, meteorological data, and soil
properties. To avoid overfitting and iterative refinement in prediction, a gradientenhancement factor is employed. From experimental findings, GEMLP Model significantly
outperforms conventional models with an R2 of 97%. The findings demonstrate the
capability of machine learning-based models to revolutionize precision agriculture. GEMLP
Model provides farmers, policymakers, and agronomists with a strong tool for yield
forecasting, resource optimization, and sustainable agriculture through scalable data-driven
projection capability. In opening the gateway of agro-analytics to further borders, this
research paves the way for optimal decision making by modern farming, strategies.
